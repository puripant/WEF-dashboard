# A Visualization of Global Competitiveness Report (World Economic Forum)

Yet another visual display to present indicators across countries and time frames. All (hundreds of) indices of a country are represented as a histogram. Different hues for different countries (Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam) and different shades for different years (2018, 2013, and 2008). Built with Vega-Lite.
